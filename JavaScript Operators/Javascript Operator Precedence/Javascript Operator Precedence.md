## Javascript Operator Precedence:
Operators have precedence. Precedence defines the order in which the expression will be evaluated. Operators are used to building expression. Expressions are sequences of operators and operands that are evaluated to a single value.

# Operator Precedence from highest to lowest.
# Precedence	Operators
Colons can be used to align columns.

| Precedence        | Operators           
| ------------- |:-------------
| Highest       | ( )
|               |++ â€” (postfix) new typeof 
| col 2 is      | centered      
| zebra stripes | are neat      

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the 
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.
